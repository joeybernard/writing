Modelling the entire universe


This month we will look at the largest thing possible, the whole universe. At least that is the claim made by celestia, the software package we are going to look at this month. In all seriousness, though, celestia is a very well done astronomical simulator, similar to other software packages like stellarium. Celestia is completely open-source, licensed under the GPL. If you don't have celestia available under the package management system for your favourite distribution, you can always get the latest stable version from the main web site for celestia as an installable binary package. If you really need the absolute latest version, you can grab the github repository. There are also binaries available for Windows and Mac OSX, just in case you need to travel on the dark side of computing.

Once you have celestia installed, starting it up will give you a view of the Earth from space. [celestia1.png] You are placed on a track that will follow the Earth through space. This is necessary because celestia is actually a real-time simulation. If you were in a fixed location in space, the object that you are looking at would quickly leave your field of view. You can pause the simulation by hitting the space bar. Once you are following an object, you can rotate your view by clicking the left mouse button and dragging left/right or up/down. You may be more interested in observing the centered object, instead. In this case, clicking the right mouse button and dragging will move you around the object instead. This way, you can see the details of the object. You can zoom in or out by using the mouse wheel. All of these navigation actions also have keyboard shortcuts, for those who prefer that to using a mouse.

But, how do you select which object you are centered on? The easiest option is to click the menu item "Navigation->Solar System Browser" to pop up a selection window. [celestia2.png] From here, you can pick from the planets, moons, asteroids and other solar system objects available by default within celestia.
