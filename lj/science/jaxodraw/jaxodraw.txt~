Feynman Figures For Fun


In quantum physics, one of the calculations you may do is to figure out how two or more particles may interact. This can get rather complicated and confusing once you get to more than two particles interacting. Also, depending on the interaction, there may be the creation and annihilation of virtual particles as part of the interaction. How can you keep all of this stright and figure out what may be happening here? Enter the Feynman diagram. American physicist Richard Feynman developed Feynman diagrams in 1948. They represent complex quantum particle interactions through a set very simple diagrams, made up of straight lines, wavy lines and curly lines. This works really well if you happen to be using a chalk board, or a white board. But these media are not very useful in sharing your ideas across the internet. There is also the issue of most word processing software not being able to draw these diagrams in your articles, papers and documents. So what can you do? Enter the software package of the month, JaxoDraw.

JaxoDraw provides a graphical environment for drawing Feynman diagrams on your computer. JaxoDraw is a Java application, and so should run on any OS that has a reasonably recent Java virtual machine. There are currently only packages for Fedora and Gentoo. But there are both source and binary downloads available. The binary download is a jar file containing everything you need. There are also installers for Windows and a disk image for Mac OSX users. There is also always the ability to download the source files and compile JaxoDraw for yourself, or make alterations to the sources to add extra functionality. JaxoDraw supports a plugin architecture, with documentation on how to create your own. This might be a more effective way of adding any extra functionality that you are looking for.

We'll use the most flexible setup for JaxoDraw. This involves downloading a tarball from the main web site, in the downloads section. The file name you should see is "jaxodraw-x.x-x-bin.tar.gz". Once this file is downloaded, you can unpack it with the command
   tar xvzf jaxodraw-x.x-x-bin.tar.gz
This will create a subdirectory containing the jar file and some documentation files. To start up JaxoDraw, first change to the new subdirectory and run
   java -jar jaxodraw-x.x-x.jar
Just be aware that currently, the GNU Java virtual machine doesn't run JaxoDraw. On start up, you will have an empty canvas and a list of the elements available to draw your Feynman diagram. [img1.png] The left hand side is broken into several sections, including the types of particles or the types of edits available. JaxoDraw uses XML files to save Feynman diagrams. This way you can load them again later to make edits or build up more complicated reactions.

To begin drawing, you first select an object type from the left hand side. The regular particle types are fermions (straight lines), scalars (dashed lines), ghost (dotted lines), photons (wiggly line) and gluons (pig-tailed lines). In the diagrams, there are four versions of these particle lines: lines, arcs, loops and beziers. Once you select one of these, you can draw on the canvas by clicking and dragging to draw the relevant line. You can draw anywhere on the canvas, or you can force the drawing to snap to grid points. The spacing of these grid points is adjustable in the preferences. At least in the beginning, you will probably want to turn this on so that you get the different sections of your drawing to line up. Each of the elements of you drawing has properties that can be edited. Depending on the element, these might be color, size or location. There is also a text element that you can use to label your diagram. You can enter text in either LaTeX format or PostScript format. This allows you to use special characters, like Greek letters, in your text label. You can group a number of diagram elements together a single entity. This grouped entity can then be moved as a single object. You can group together these groups into super groups. There is no technical limit to this type of nesting.

Once you have your diagram finished, you should save it off as a JaxoDraw XML file. This way, you can always go back and recreate the diagram if needed. You can export your Feynman diagram in one of several formats. You can export into image files (JPEG and PNG). This is useful if you are using PowerPoint, or web pages, or some other software package that doesn't understand LaTeX or PostScript. You also have the option to export into LaTeX or PostScript file formats. If you export to LaTeX, you will need to include the JaxoDraw LaTeX style file to handle the rendering of your Feynman diagram. This style file is called "axodraw4j.sty", which is based on J. Vermaseren's original "axodraw.sty". This is now a separate download from the main JaxoDraw application download. You will want to install this where your LaTeX installation can find it and use it. The easiest thing to do is to copy it into the same directory as your LaTeX document source files. LaTeX searches here by default when you render your LaTeX documents. "axodraw4j.sty" is still in beta, so you may want to stick with the original axodraw package.

So now that we have looked at some of the features of JaxoDraw, let's look at drawing one of the classic particle interactions. This is where an electron and a positron collide, producing photons. The first step is to draw two fermions, with arrows pointing in opposite directions. [img3.png] In these diagrams, space is in the vertical direction and time is in the horizontal direction. Time increases from left to right. The electron and positron collide and annihilate, producing at least one photon. [img4.png]

As of the writing of this article, there are four plugins available. These are different export functions. Two of them are for exporting to PDF or SVG file formats. The third one is to serialize your diagram in the Java binary file serialization format. This format should be functionally equivalent to the XML file format, but it is smaller and loads faster, especially for larger diagrams. The only problem with it is that it is a binary file format, so you can't take a look inside it. The last plugin is just a text exporter. It provides a template to show you what a simple custom exporter looks like. JaxoDraw has a plugin manager to handle installing and uninstalling plugins. You simply have to download the relevant jar file, then use the plugin manager to install it. Plugins are stored at "$HOME/.jaxodraw/$VERSION/plugins". If you wish, you can manually install plugins by dropping the associated jar file in this directory. To unnstall manually, you can deleted the relevant jar file and any corresponding property files from this location.

With the possible sighting of the Higgs boson at the LHC, interest in particle physics is growing. Now, with JaxoDraw, you too can write about particle interactions and be able to draw a proper picture to show others what you are trying to describe. Have fun, and share your insights with others.
