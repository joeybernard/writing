Open Source Space

As I right this, NASA has just passed another milestone in releasing their work into the open source community. A press release came out announcing the release on Thursday, April 10, of a new catalog of their software that is available as open source. This new catalog includes both older software that was previously available, along with new software being released for the first time. The kinds of items available include project management systems, design tools, data handling and image processing. In this article, we will take a quick look at some of the cool codes available.

The main website is located at http://technology.nasa.gov. This main page is used as a central portal to access all of the technology available to be transfered to the public. This includes patents, as well as software. As a quick start, there is a subject cloud in the lower central region of the page that can do a search on several different keywords for you. Unfortunately, this is only a catalog of all of the offerings, and is not quite complete yet in terms of the detailed information. So, for example, if you click on "Command Control", you will be taken to a results page that includes items like "Rendezvous and Proximity Operations Program (RPOP)". If you click on this, you will be taken to a details page that is essentially unpopulated. The assumption is that this will be filled in as time allows in the future. This does give you a list of what is available, though, which is half of the battle. Staying on the result list page, you should notice that there is the name of a NASA center on the right hand side of each line. This is the actual source for the given patent or software entry. Once you find something of interest, you can go to the individual center's web site to find more details about it. On the lower right section of the main page of the NASA technology site, you can find direct links to the technology sections for each of the individual centers. The amount of information available at each of these centers varies, but you should be able to find out more details. On some of the sites, you will have direct download links to get the software that you are interested in. In other cases, you will have the contact details for a person that you need to talk to in order to get copies of the software in question.

Off of the front page, there is a set of other useful NASA links on the lower left side. The one labeled "NASA Open Source Software" (http://code.nasa.gov) will take you to a sister site that will give you access to

Now that we've looked at a few of the newly released codes at NASA, hopefully you will have your interest piqued enough to go exploring through the more than 1000 other codes available there. You never know what you may find. If you find something really interesting, share with the rest of us.
