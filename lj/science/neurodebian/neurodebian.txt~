Linux Help for Neuroscientists


In the past, we have looked at distributions that were built with some scientific discipline in mind. This month, we will take a look at yet another one. In this case, we will checkout what is provided by neurodebian. We should probably start by clarifying that neurodebian is not strictly a Linux distribution in the classical sense. The people behind neurodebian began by working on PyMVPA, a Python package to do multivariate pattern analysis of neural data. To make this package easy to deploy, neurodebian was created. Over time, more and more packages were added to neurodebian to try and create the ultimate integrated environment for neuroscience.

Installing neurodebian is a bit different from other distributions. On the main home page, there is a section called "Get NeuroDebian". Here you can select which distribution you use as your desktop and which mirror you want to download from.
