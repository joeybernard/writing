Designing Electronics with Linux

In many scientific disciplines, the research you may be doing is completely new. It may be so new that there isn't even any instrumentation available to make your experimental measurements. In these cases, you have no choice but to design and build your own measuring devices. While you could build these using trial and error, having a way to model them first to see how they will behave is a much better choice. In steps oregano. With oregano, you can design your circuitry ahead of time and run simulations on it to iron out any problems that you may find with it. The first step is always to get the software installed. Most distributions should have a package for oregano available. If you want to follow the source version, it is available at github. Oregano also needs another software package to handle the actual simulation. The two that it can currently work with are gnucap and ngspice. Either of these two packages need to be installed in order to actually do the calculations needed for the simulation. While this is handled automagically by your distribution's package manager, you will need to install this dependency yourself if you are building from source.

Once you have it installed, you will get a blank new project when you first start up oregano. [oregano1.png] On the right hand side, you should see a list of elements that you can use to build up your circuits. It starts up with the default library selected. This library gives you all of the standard electronic components that you will likely want to use. But this isn't the only library included. You can select from other libraries, such as TTL, Linear, CPU or Power Devices, among others. Each of these libraries contain a list of associated elements that you can use in your circuits. Selecting one of the elements will show a preview of the schematic drawing of that element in the bottom window. You can then drag and drop the element onto your canvas and start building up your circuit. Once you have an element on the canvas, you can double-click the element to edit the properties of this element. [oregano2.png] You will need to click on the "Draw wires" icon at the top of the window in order to connect the elements together into a proper circuit. All circuits have some necessary components in order to actually have a functioning circuit. The first of these is the ground. This element is labeled GND in the default library. Along with ground, you will need some sort of power source. In most cases, you will want some form of DC current. This is provided by the element labeled with VDC in the default library. With these two important elements in your circuit, go ahead wire up the rest of the circuit.

Once you have a circuit made up, you will want to run a simulation to see how it behaves. Because of the nature of electrical circuits, you need to put sensors into the circuit to see how it is behaving. You can click on the "Add voltage clamp" icon at the the top of the window to select the sensor object. Then you can click on the areas of your circuit that you want to measure during the simulation. At each point you click, you will see a new icon on your circuit marking a sensor location. Double-clicking on the clamp will pop up a window where you can set the parameters of what is being measured. [oregano3.png] You need at least one clamp in your circuit before you can run a simulation, otherwise you won't have any measurements to study in your simulation. Once you have all of your clamp points selected, you can go ahead and run the simulation and see what happens by clicking on the "Run a simulation" icon at the top of the window.. [oregano4.png] When you do so, oregano will open a new window where you can see a plot of the data registered by the clamp (usually voltage or current).
