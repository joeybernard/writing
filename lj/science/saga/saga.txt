GIS on Linux

This month, we'll look at another GIS option available on Linux. Specifically, a program called SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses). SAGA was developed at the Department of Physical Geography in Germany. It is built with a plugin module architecture, where various functions are provided by individual modules. There is a very complete API that is available to allow users to extend out the functionality of SAGA with newly written modules.
