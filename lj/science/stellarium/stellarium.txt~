Astronomy on the Desktop

For many citizen scientists, their first exposure to science is through astronomy. Many people become inspired by that first look through a telescope, or their first glimpse of a Hubble image. There are several software packages available on the Linux desktop that allow you to continue on this love of the stars. We'll look at several packages that should be available in most distributions.

The first one we'll look at is stellarium. Stellarium is actually my personal favorite for day-to-day stargazing. When you install it, you get a thorough star catalog to start with. By default, stellarium starts up in fullscreen mode. [stellarium1.png] The layout makes for a very attractive display of the sky above you. Almost all of the details of the display are customizable. If you hover your mouse pointer over either the bottom left border, or the lower left side border, one of two configuration panels will appear. From here, you can set visual items like constellation outlines, constellation names, whether galaxies and nebulae are visible, as well as displaying a coordinate grid. You can also set location and time values. This means that you can not only see what the sky looked like in the past or what it will look like in the future, but you can also see what it looks like on the other side of the planet. You can add even more stars to the catalog that stellarium uses.

Stellarium includes a script capability. With it, you can script views of starfields and share them with others. When you install stellarium you get several demo scripts that you can use as examples. As of version 0.10.1, there is a new scripting engine based on the Qt scripting engine. There is a full API available, allowing you to interact with all of the functions that stellarium provides. It is a full scripting language, called ECMAscript. You may know it better as JavaScript. You can define your own functions, encapsulating larger chunks of work. There is a for statement, providing a loop structure that looks familiar to C and Java programmers. To access and run scripts in stellarium, you need to open the configuration window and click on the scripts tab. Once you've written your own scripts and want to run them, you can place them in the scripts subdirectory of the user data directory. On Linux machines, the user data directory is $HOME/.stellarium. Once you put your script files here, along with any textures it may require, it will show up within the list of scripts in the configuration window. There is also a plugin architecture available, but it is much harder to use, and the API varies from version to version.

The nice thing about stellarium is that it isn't limited to your computer. It can interact with the real world in a couple of different ways. The first is through telescope control. Stellarium provides two different mechanisms for controlling your telescope. The older mechanism is a client-server model. The server runs as a stand-alone application that connects to and controls one telescope. It can then listen to one or more clients, which can include stellarium. There are several options available for the server portion, and these provide control for many telescopes from Meade, Celestron and others. The second mechanism is a plugin for stellarium. This was first available in version 0.10.3. This mechanism can only send slew instructions to the telescope, which is essentially a "go to" instruction. One major warning is that stellarium will not stop you from slewing to the sun. This could damage both eyes and equipment if you don't have proper filters on your telescope, so always becareful if you are working during the day. The plugin can interact with pretty much any telescope that understands either the Meade LX200 interface or the Celestron NexStar interface. The other way that stellarium can interact with the real world is as a planetarium. Stellarium can handle the calculations involved in projecting over a sphere. This way, you can make a DIY planetarium. You will need a dome onto which you can project your display, across the inside. You will also need a video projector and a spherical security mirror. When you use the spherical distortion feature in stellarium and then project the results through the video projector and onto the mirror. Then you can lay back under the dome and see the sky above you. There are groups on the internet where you can find help and hints when building your own. These links are available from the stellarium site.

The other popular astronomy program is celestia. Celestia is a three dimensional simulation of the universe. Where most astronomy software shows you what the sky looks like from the surface of the earth, celestia can show you what the sky looks like from anywhere in the solar system. [celestia1.png] Celestia has a powerful scripting engine that allows you to produce tours of the universe. When you install celestia, you get a script called demo.cel that gives you an idea of its capabilities. In the add-on section of the celestia web site there is a full repository of scripts available. Because so much work has been done to make it as scientifically accurate as possible, it is also being used in an educational environment. Currently there are 12 journeys available that provide information for students, and the general public, on the wonders of the universe. As opposed to scripts, journeys give you more control over your speed and pace, allowing you take more time at the areas that are of most interest to you. When you install celestia, you get the core part of the program, and a few extra add-ons. There are currently over 500 add-ons available, and if you install them all you will need over 18GB of drive space. The main repository you should stop at first is located at http://www.celestiamotherlode.net.

If you want to travel to another planet in the solar system, you can click on "Navigation->Go to Object...". [celestia3.png] Here you can enter the name of the object and how far away you want to be. Then you can click on "Go To" and get taken directly there. Once you are there you can rotate your camera view with the arrow keys. In this way, you can go to Mars, turn around and see what the sky looks like from here. [celestia4.png] If you want to move around the orbit of the body you are currently at, you can use shift and the arrow keys to slide around and see the whole surface of Mars in our example here. What you see when you are in orbit around another planet is a texture mapped onto the body. The core installation of celestia includes a minimal set of textures that strive to be as accurate as possible. You can change the textures being used by including add-ons from the repository. Some of these include textures that allow you to see what the Earth may have looked at during the last ice age, or even 4 billion years ago.

In 2007, Vincent Giangiulio created an add-on called Lua Edu Tools. This add-on provides all kinds of extra functionality to celestia. There is a toolkit that gets displayed on the right side of the screen, giving you sliders to control many of the parameters of celestia. It also provides a "cockpit" overlay, making it feel even more like you're flying through space. The default texture is the space shuttle, but you can use other ones, too. Celestia also lets you use a joystick to control movement, so you can completely immerse yourself into your dream of flying through space.

You can share your experiences with others by saving either still images or movies. If you click on "File->Capture Image...", celestia lets you save off a PNG or JPEG image file. If you click on "File->Capture Movie..." lets you save off a movie of your travels. You can set the aspect ratio, the frame rate and the video quality. Once you click on "Save", celestia will be ready to start recording. When you are ready, click on the key "F11" to start recording. When you're done, you can stop recording by clicking the key "F12".

In both cases, this article was only an introduction to what you can do. But hopefully, this will inspire to go explore the universe on your desktop. And from there, bundle up and go spend the night out under the skies. You won't regret it.
