Poor Man's Reporting

If you need to get status reports out of a system and can't install a full-featured package, you can still get results delivered to your mailbox. You can set up a cron entry using

crontab -e

and then adding the line

0 8,13 * * *     command | mail -s "QSUM Output" xxx@unb.ca

where command is the command line executable that gives you the status information you want. Remember that in crontab, the date/time values are

minute         0-59
hour           0-23
day of month   1-31
month          1-12
day of week    0-7
