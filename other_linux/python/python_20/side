You might be interested in having more complex control over the Twitter account for your Raspberry Pi project. The Twitter Python module provides full access to the Twitter API, so you can make changes to the relationships between this account and other Twitter users. You can follow another user with the function 'CreateFriendship()'. If you change your mind, you can unfollow a user with the function 'DestroyFriendship()'. What might be of more interest, however, is to checkout how many people are following you. Or, more specifically, how many people are following your Raspberry Pi project. You can get a sequence of Twitter users who are following your project with the function 'GetFollowers()'. The default maximum number of returned followers is 200. So, if your project becomes really popular, you will need to use the function 'GetFollowersPaged()' to get all of your followers in groups of 200. You can control which page gets returned with the option 'cursor=X'. The defaults also return the statuses for all of these users, which you may not necessarily want to have to process. If so, you can use the option 'skip_status=True'. You can also get the number of Twitter friends with the function 'GetFriends()'. In this case, the default number of results returned is 20. You can increase this with the option 'count=X' up to a maximum of 200. If you have more than 200 friends, you can get paged results here, too. You can control which page of results to return with the 'cursor' option, just as above. If you want to get a broader look at who is checking out your project, you can use the function 'GetMentions()' to see who is mentioning the user account for your project. You get the last 20 mentions by default, but you can request up to 200. Another measure of your reach into the public sphere is how many retweets you get. You can find out by using the function 'GetRetweetsOfMe()'. The default number returned is 20, but you can ask for up to 100 of the latest retweets. With these extra functions, you can actually have your Raspberry Pi project interacting with the world in general and monitor its own ability to communicate with the public. This might be handy for citizen science projects.
