Over the last few issues, we've looked at some fundamental concepts in Python around objects, object-oriented programming, and how objects are stored in memory. This issue, let's take a loook at the Raspberry Pi, and one of the unique features not usually offered on single-board computers. Of course, I'm speaking of the GPIO pins. GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output. They provide an interface between the Raspberry Pi and the outside world. These pins can act as either inputs into the computer, or outputs to the outside world.
