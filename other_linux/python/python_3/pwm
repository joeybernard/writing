Digital output is only on or off, high or low. So, how can you output anything different? One option is PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation. This system essentially sends out a series of highs and lows at some set frequency. This is useful in robotics, where you can use PWM signals to run servo motors. Your Raspberry Pi can also output PWM. To use it, you need to create a PWM object instance with the command 'p = GPIO.PWM(pin, freq)', where 'pin' is the output pin you wish to use and 'freq' is the frequency of the output pulses. You also need to use the setup command to set the output mode of the pin in question. To start the output, you need to use 'p.start(dc)' where 'dc' is the duty cycle (between 0.0 and 100.0). Once you are done, you can stop the output with 'p.stop()' and then cleanup with 'GPIO.cleanup()'. You could use this functionality to blink your LED at some set frequency. You can change the output frequency with 'p.ChangeFrequency(freq)', and the duty cycle with 'p.ChangeDutyCycle(dc)'. In this way, you can create some rather complex output patterns for your circuits.
