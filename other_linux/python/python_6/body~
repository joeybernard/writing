If you do even a cursory search online, you will be able to find any number of modules that will add functionality to your Raspberry Pi. Many of these are sensor modules that let you observe the world around you. What you may not know is that you probably already have a very powerful sensor module that you can use with your Raspberry Pi if you own an XBox, the Kinect sensor. The Kinect connects through a regular USB cable, so theoretically it could be connected to your Raspberry Pi.
