@Title (probably something like 'The Python column'
@standfirst (what you're coving in this column - a nice hook to reel people in - 10-20 words)

@body copy 1000 words


@ boxout - a good 200 words on a topic related or expanded upon from the body copy. This could include code. 

@code - if you can do some example code all the better. We can style it up properly. Max of 50-70 lines, though.
