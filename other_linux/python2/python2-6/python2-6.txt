-feel free to include commands and small segments of code in-line with the body text, but for larger chunks of code please use figure references or refer people to the coverdisc as we can supply them with code, if you send it in with your commission.
Note: please indicate where code starts and ends with /c/ and any output with /o/, as it enables a non-tech savvy art person to layout the pages e.g.
/c/
$ telnet 192.168.1.200 8000
/c/
/o/
Trying 192.168.1.200...

Code takes up a lot of space, so if you decide to separate out any code onto a line on its own you will need to REMOVE words from the total word count for the section your writing. This works out as follows:
One line of code is equal to 30 words (we have a line break before and after code that is being pulled out of the body copy, which is why it takes up more space), two lines of code are equal to 40 words and three lines are equal to 50 words and so on.

Note: We've included the number of characters as an extra useful reference for each section as sometimes a word count can be less accurate depending on the length of words that are used.

@ Intro text  -  180 words
In this column, we have looked at lots of different projects that you could use your Raspberry Pi for. While we looked at code that was specific for each project, such as how to talk to Bluetooth devices or communicate over the GPIO bus, we did not do much with how to interact with people. This month, we will take a look at Kivy, in order to be able to create graphical displays and dashboards. Kivy is a multi-platform library for Python that gives you the tools you need to build a GUI for your Python code. While we will be looking at using it on the Raspberry Pi, Kivy is available on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX and even Android. So, you can take the examples given here and reuse them in lots of other projects. Along with dashboard displays, Kivy provides several different interface options, like buttons, touch screens and even multi-touch interfaces. By the end of this article, you should have the tools you need to add a really useful interface to your Raspberry Pi project.



@ Body text

@ Subheading1  -  Installation
Installation is pretty easy if you are using Raspbian, or some other Debian variant, as the distribution on your Raspberry Pi. You can install it with the following command:
/c/
sudo apt-get install python-kivy
/c/
If you have moved to writing your code using Python 3, you can install the package 'python3-kivy' instead. There is also the package 'python-kivy-examples', which provides a number of sample pieces of code. These are handy to have locally on your development machine. This gives you code snippets without having to be online. They are located in the directory '/usr/share/kivy-examples'. It is definitely worth taking a look in this location to see examples of all of the things you could add to your own program.

@ Subheading2  -  Hello World
Since Kivy is a full GUI toolkit, it will involve a bit more boilerplate code wrapping the actual functional bits. For example, the code below is an example of a 'Hello World' program.
/c/
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label
class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Label(text='Hello world')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
/c/
As you can see, the first step is to import the 'App' class, and implement your own subclass based on it. In this case, the subclass is named 'MyApp'. The primary method that you must implement is the 'build()' function. This method gets executed when your app starts and generates the actual windows and other display elements. In the above example, the code simply generates a Label object in order to show the text 'Hello World'. Once you have the code saved in a Python script file, named 'myapp.py' for example, you can simply run it with the command 'python myapp.py'.

@ Subheading3  -  Displaying Data
Moving beyond a simple text display, what tools does Kivy provide for displaying data? Since we're talking graphical displays, you probably want to start with being able to display images in your program. This is handled through the Image class. For example, you could add the following to the earlier boilerplate.
/c/
from kivy.uix.image import Image
....
    def build(self):
        return Image(source='image.png')
/c/
This loads up and displays the image file given as the source for the Image class. This works great for images stored locally, but you may want to load images from some remote source, like a web server. In these cases, you may want to use the 'AsyncImage' class instead. This puts the loading of the image into the background and keeps the rest of your program from blocking while the image is being loaded. There are quite a few parameters to the class instantiation that help control the image display. You can set 'allow_stretch' to let the image fill the containing box. The image ratio is kept by default, but you could allow it to get stretched regardless by setting the parameter 'keep_ratio' to False. If the image your are loading is an animated GIF file, Kivy gives you control over it. You can set how many times to loop through it with the parameter 'anim_loop', while you can control how fast the animation happens with the parameter 'anim_delay'. If your system is actually updating the image file, say you are updating a plot with new data, you can tell your program to reload the new image data with the method 'reload()'.

You may, instead, need to build up your graphical imagery from scratch. The subsection 'kivy.graphics' contains a number of graphical primitives that you can use to build up required imagery. These primitives include objects like lines, ellipses, points, rectangles, beziers and triangles. There are also a number of methods available to alter these graphical elements. These include transformational functions like translate, scale and rotate. You have other standard graphical elements, like pop ups and labels, that allow you to display textual information. For example, the following displays the contents of a text file:
/c/
from kivy.uix.label import Label
text_file = open('my_file.txt')
text_str = text_file.read()
label1 = Label(text=text_str)
/c/
You can control the layout of the text with parameters such as 'font_name', 'font_size', 'color', 'halign' and 'valign'. You can even make your text box interactive by adding the markup '[ref=XXXX]' and '[/ref]', where 'XXXX' is a label for the reference. This makes the text surrounded by these delineators a link that can have some function bound to it. The following code shows how you would get the function 'my_func' to fire when the word hello gets clicked.
/c/
label1 = Label(text='[ref=hello]Hello[/ref] World', markup=True)
label1.bind(on_ref_press=my_func)
/c/
As you can see, you also need to include the parameter 'markup=True' so that the markup tags get processed correctly.

The last big graphical element that you can add to your program is the ability to play video files. All of the really hard work is wrapped up in a very complete VideoPlayer object. With the following code, you get a video display with all of the usual playback controls.
/c/
from kivy.uix.videoplayer import VideoPlayer
player = VideoPlayer(source='my_film.avi', state='play')
/c/
This loads the video file and starts it playing immediately. It also includes all of the standard controls so that the end user can control playback.

@ Subheading4  -  Layouts
While we have looked at a lot of the elements that can be used to display things within your program, we have not looked at how they are actually laid out on the screen. As with many other graphical toolkits, Kivy gives you a set of classes, called layouts, that manage the physical organization of the various elements. As a basic example, the following code draws two buttons, one above the other.
/c/
layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')
btn1 = Button(text='Hello')
btn2 = Button(text='World')
layout.add_widget(btn1)
layout.add_widget(btn2)
/c/
The first line creates the layout object, oriented vertically. Then, two button objects are created. All of the objects that generate graphical elements for your program subclass the basic class for widgets. So you can use the 'add_widget()' method of the layout object to add them to the display. The box layout can be thought of as a one dimensional layout, where you can have your widgets grouped either vertically or horizontally. Moving up one dimension, you use the grid layout object. Unlike many other graphical toolkits, you do not have direct control over where widgets are placed within the grid. They get placed simply in the order that they are added to the layout object. They are laid out in row first order. You need to give the grid layout at least one of either the cols or rows parameter. The sizing of the widgets need to match. That is, all of the widgets in a given column need to be the same width and any widgets in a given row need to be the same height. If you want to be more flexible in the sizing of your widgets, you may want to use the stack layout instead. In a stack layout, widgets in a given row or column no longer need to be the same height or width. 

You can move up another dimension by using the page layout object. This creates a multi-page layout where widgets can be added to each page, and you can flip back and forth between them using the borders. A more structured layout object is the anchor layout. In this case, you define an 'anchor_x' and 'anchor_y' parameter. These can take on the values of top, center or bottom. This essentially pins the children of the anchor layout to one of the borders.

@ Subheading5  -  Interacting with the World
Many of your projects will also need to accept input from end users. This could come in a variety of forms. We have already seen buttons in some of the earlier code examples. Moving beyond the button, Kivy provides a toggle button. The toggle behaves much like a checkbox does. You can make it behave more like a set of radio buttons by using the group parameter. In this case, only one member of the group can be in the down state at a time.

While these types of input values are simple on or off values, that may not be enough. In these cases, you can add a slider to your program.
/c/
from kivy.uix.slider import Slider
s = Slider(min=-100, max=100)
/c/
You can read off the value that the user has set it to by checking the value property of the slider. You can also set this value property, which will reset the slider to that position on the display.

For the inputting of textual data, you have a couple of options. The first is the 'TextInput' class. This class allows you to add a text box where the user can add whatever data they wish to type in. It handles cursor movements within the text box, as well as clipboard interaction with the operating system. If you need a more robust textual input option, you may want to look at the CodeInput class. This class lets you embed, essentially, an IDE within your code. You also need to have the Python module pygments installed, as it provides highlighting to the widget. Any of the langauges that are supported by pygments gets highlighted within the code editor window. For example, the following code creates a code input widget that highlights Cython code.
/c/
from kivy.uix.codeinput import CodeInput
from pygments.lexers import CythonLexer
codeinput = CodeInput(lexer=CythonLexer())
/c/
There are a huge number of lexers available with pygments. In the rare instances where you need a lexer for some obscure language, you can always build your own.

@ Subheading6  -  Events
We've looked at all sorts of display options, as well as ways that users can input their own data or interact with your program. But how do you manage the actions that are triggered by these interactions? Whenever you actually do anything, such as clicking on a button or typing some text, these actions trigger events within Kivy. Widgets all implement the EventDispatcher to manage these events in a background thread of execution. As you have seen above, events are managed by callback functions that are bound to one or more of these actions. There are several available as part of the widget class. For example, the following code notifies you of any changes in the state of a button.
/c/
def callback(instance, value):
    print('My button <%s> state is <%s>' % (instance, value))
btn1 = Button(text='Hello world 1')
btn1.bind(state=callback)
/c/
This binds the callback function to the state property of the button. Anytime it changes, the callback function gets fired. You can even create your own with the 'register_event_type()' method of the widget class.

Along with these class events, there are also input events.

@ Supporting images
3 images required; please indicate whether we need to crop in on a particular part of a screenshot.

If you wish to include diagrams, supply a reference copy and we will re-create this in-house.

If you are referencing sections of code, please make them as Figure 1, 2 and so on and mention them in the copy.

@ Captions
Images need captions, which need to be around 15 words each.

A note on captions:
These are a device intended to provide additional information that's not directly in the text of the tutorial or simply stating what the picture is of. A caption that effectively says 'This is X' isn't a good caption.

@ 2x boxouts
60 words each (roughly 350 chars); Needs a title up to 5 words. The contents can be a general tip/trick or piece of knowledge related to this tutorial, or you can go into greater depth on one particular aspect of it.

A note on boxouts:
Boxouts are intended to be 'access points' into the page, so they are meant to be interesting little reads in their own right that hopefully encourage someone scanning the page to dip into the whole tutorial. You can never assume that the reader is actually going to read your words, you have to use all the tricks to encourage them to read.

@ 2x Pullquotes
Choose a short quote, around 15 words, to pull the reader in as they flick through the pages.
